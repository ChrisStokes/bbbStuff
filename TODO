Firmware:
  check if everything in fragments 0-7 are necessary  LOW
  check if the other analog channels can be disabled  LOW
  rename all the device overlays

Hardware:
  add high voltage current sensing to incorporate the pressure sensors
  add voltage divider so AIN can monitor source voltage  LOW

Software:
  pull out the deadband parameters from closed loop test
  centralize all the parameters, a model file probably
  write calibration scripts
  do constant velocity test
  make realtime graphing (over the network)
  start thinking about interfacing with the existing code
  FRP?
  start thinking about a UI
