Firmware:
  rename all the device overlays

Hardware:
  add high voltage current sensing to incorporate the pressure sensors
    - Pressure sensors: 
      - Supply pressure
      - each side of piston for both joints
      - return pressure
  add voltage divider so AIN can monitor source voltage  LOW
  add 3rd solenoid driver channel (4th? Do we need to support dual yaw piston option?)
  add 3rd analog port for string pots
  look into 12V switching regulator for solenoids and pressure sensors
  choose cables and connectors
  choose enclosures
  update schematic and pcb layout
  bypass ports for manual control


Software:
  pull out the deadband parameters from closed loop test
  centralize all the parameters, a model file probably
  write calibration scripts
  make realtime graphing (over the network)  (maybe storm?)
  start thinking about interfacing with the existing code
  start thinking about a UI  (LOW)
  document a comm protocol
  hook up all the networking code
  do the physics
  add force inputs to BBB code
  import the gate code and the IK
  import the joystick code
  enforce speed ramps at all times
  port SoftStopAwareSpeedManager to python, integrate
  check out the pyode code, adapt it?
  make E stop
  write server code
