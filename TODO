Firmware:
  rename all the device overlays

Hardware:
  System level:
    - Design engine control board
    - Port documentation to wiki
    - Determine whether to use central 12V reg or chip on CoS
    - 

  Cape of Stomping Redesign
    - Pick power connectors
    - Pick String Pot connectors
    - Pick 12V 5A switching regulator (if it's going on the cape)

  Cape of Stomping Schematic updates
    - Update power connector part
    - Update SPI connector part
    - Switch to 5 pair SPI
    - Update string pot connector part
    - Switch to single 12pin connector for solenoid valves

  Cape of Stomping PCB updates
    - Create footprint for power connector
    - Create footprint for SPI connector
    - Create footprint for string pot connector
    - Create footprint for solenoid valves connector
    - Redo layout
    - Resize board if necessary. Check enclosure size
    - Redo routing
    - Make sure ports are labeled

  Magnetic Encoder board PCB updates
    - Make board 1.5" x 1.5"
    - Move sensor to dead center
    - Add mounting holes
    - Change to 5 pair connector
    - Update routing
    - Submit PCB order
    - Submit parts order 


Software:
  pull out the deadband parameters from closed loop test
  centralize all the parameters, a model file probably
  write calibration scripts
  make realtime graphing (over the network)  (maybe storm?)
  start thinking about interfacing with the existing code
  start thinking about a UI  (LOW)
  document a comm protocol
  hook up all the networking code
  do the physics
  add force inputs to BBB code
  import the gate code and the IK
  import the joystick code
  enforce speed ramps at all times
  port SoftStopAwareSpeedManager to python, integrate
  check out the pyode code, adapt it?
  make E stop
  write server code
  Make sure dithering is implemented
